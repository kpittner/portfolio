      <div class="biography">
        <p>My coding adventure started my senior year of college. The web design and programming courses instantly captivated me.
          I decided to pursue it further by taking another programming class after I graduated. I want to get my masters degree in Computer Science but it would take at least another two years;
          it was then that I discovered The Iron Yard and knew it was where I was supposed to be.
          I know this is the career path for me. My desire is to become a full stack developer.
